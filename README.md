## Xeno Debloater 💻  🪟 Windows 10-11

👋 Created by myself (currently looking for contributors)

🔹 Easy to use - Simple and clean GUI for effortless navigation.
🔹 Inspired by Chris Titus Tool - A more streamlined experience tailored for my needs.
🔹 Fully customizable - Select the tweaks and apps that fit your workflow.

⚡ Why I Made This
I love the Chris Titus Tech tool, but I found the UI a bit confusing at first. I wanted a modern, easy-to-navigate debloater with only the essential tweaks and apps. So, I created Trinity Debloater—a simpler, more intuitive alternative.
