## Trinity Debloater üíª

**Made by myself only (Looking for others to contribuite)



this tools purpose is to be the most simpile but yet sleek and sophisticaited for power users to also get to 
enjoy what it offers, before i explain some of the uses let me say i got all of the inspiration
from the Chris Titus Tool, i think the tool is amazing, the only complaint i had was the way
it was kinda hard to navigaite and how many extra apps there were for my needs and the tweaks
were a bit confusing for me when i first started. So with that in mind i made the GUI more modern
and then started to add multipile apps and tweaks so this would be easier for atleast my use so enjoy
