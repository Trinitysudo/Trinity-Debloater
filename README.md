## Xeno Debloater  🪟 Windows 10-11

👋 Created by myself (currently looking for contributors)

🔹 **Easy to use - Simple and clean GUI for effortless navigation**

🔹 **Inspired by Chris Titus Tool - A more streamlined experience tailored for my needs.**

🔹 **Fully customizable - Select the tweaks and apps that fit your workflow.**

## ⚙️ Installation

**This will Install The Compiled exe to your Computer and run it automatically not you building it**

### ⬇️ Method 1 

1. **Go to the releases tab and download the latest release**
2. [🔗 Download Latest Release](https://github.com/Trinitysudo/Trinity-Debloater/releases/latest)
3. **After downloading the file, run it and be done**

### ⬇️ Method 2 

1. **Open PowerShell as administrator.**
2. **Copy and paste the following command and press Enter (I timed this at 27 Seconds):**
   
   ```powershell
   Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/Trinitysudo/Trinity-Debloater/releases/download/1.0/TrinityDebloater.exe" -OutFile "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\TrinityDebloater.exe"; Start-Process -FilePath "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\TrinityDebloater.exe"

## ⚡ Why I Made This

I love the Chris Titus Tech tool, but I found the UI a bit confusing at first. I wanted a modern, easy-to-navigate debloater with only the essential tweaks and apps. So, I created Trinity Debloater—a simpler, more intuitive alternative.

Please check him out as his tool is way more complex than mine and has many more features. If you want a more sophisticated experience, use his tool. THANKS
